    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      Here are my advise for reducing the risk of security attacks on your website:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Sanitazation of data</strong>: make sure that the data a system accepts is in the right format. Eiher you can manually do this or by using an third party souloution </li>
      <li> <strong>Secure authorization and authentication</strong>: Making authorization and authentication more diffucult to crack. This can be done manually or by using an "open standard authorization protocol" meaning you can for example use google to login to your service. You can also use an framework such as one login.</li>
      <li> <strong>Integrate an Continious Deplyment/Coninious Integration process.</strong> This means that every change in the code that gets pushed to production and an change that does not pass the checks will be flagged for rework. </li>
      <li> <strong>automatic user timeout</strong>: times out users who has left their credentials logged in a browser for a long time. </li>



    </ul>
